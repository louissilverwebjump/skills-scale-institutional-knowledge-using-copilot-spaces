# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs! This README is the central hub for all key process documents and practices used for project delivery at OctoAcme.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured, repeatable set of project management practices to ensure efficient execution, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Key principles include:

- **Customer-first, iterative delivery** – prioritize customer value and deliver small, testable increments.
- **Clear roles and ownership** – each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Manager (PdM), with defined responsibilities for Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.
- **Measurable goals and tracking** – use acceptance criteria, Definition of Done, and regular status reporting to stay on track.
- **Risk management** – maintain a Risk Register and address issues proactively throughout the lifecycle.
- **Strong communication cadence** – weekly PM/PdM syncs, twice-weekly standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed.
- **Continuous improvement** – capture learnings in retrospectives and apply action items to future projects.

The project lifecycle runs through five phases: **Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective**. Key artifacts include the Project Charter/one-pager, Roadmap and Release Plan, Sprint Backlog, Risk Register, and Retrospective notes.

See each linked doc below for step-by-step guides, templates, and checklists.
